This is probably one of the best tutorials on youtube or in general for make files just for the basics.

## Week 05

10. [What is virtual memory?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2quKyPnUShQ)<br>
Excellent explanation, concise, clear, informative, and entertaining. In other words the physical representation of memory and virtual memory is equivalent to how inventory is shipped to a warehouse and memory is the amount of space the warehouse can store of that shipment. Virtual memory is a shipment being processed to go either in its storage location or to be used in either to be once again shipped out or for some function in the warehouse/facility.

11. [Virtual Memory in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/)<br>
Great article with in-depth concepts for this week's material.

12. [Introduction to Threads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOfGJcVnvAk)<br>
In most of the computer applications multiprogramming and multi threading are used to improve the response time of the system while performing multiple operations or programs. Multiprogramming is a method of running multiple programs over a single processor by sharing the processor time in the time sharing environment. While multithreading is the process of running multiple threads to execute concurrently, supported by operating system.

16. [The Dining Philosophers Problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUi-u7UWgw)<br>
I thought this is some boring problem computer scientistis made up, but then I realize that 1) there could be a deadlock for naive implementation 2) there are many different ways to address the deadlock 3) different solutions have different pro and cons under different metrics. One of the most Important and famous problem with easiest solution.
